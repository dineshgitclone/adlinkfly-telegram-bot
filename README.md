  * **1-Click Deployment (Easiest):**
    1. Just click on any one of the button given at the top (in which platform you want to deploy) and follow the steps. NOTE: Make sure to Login the platform first before clicking on the button
    2. You will be asked to fill-up the Environment Variable values (check Configuration / Environment Vriables section for more info) Fill-up the values properly and proceed. That's it...!!
    * Your platform is not listed? -> I'm continuously trying to integrate more and more platforms. But, if it's still not listed You can try the custom deployment option or contact me for further info.
  * **Replit Deployment:**
    1. Use 'Import from GitHub' option to import this repo. Don't know how to do so? read [Here](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/deployments/deploying-a-github-repository)
    * Use this URL to Import:
    ```code
    https://github.com/techishfellow/adlinkfly-telegram-bot.git
    ```
    * Use this run command:
    ```code
    python3 adlinkfly_bot.py
    ```
    2. Open a 'Shell' window and run this command to install all dependencies:
    ```code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    3. Open a 'Secrets' window and configure all secrets as explained earlier (in Configuration / Environment Vriables section). Replit Secrets works the same as Environment Variables. Don't know how to use Replit Secrets? read [Here](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/workspace-features/secrets)

    4. Now just click on the green 'Run' button at the top to start the bot. That's it...!!
  * **Custom Server Deployment:**
    * IMPORTANT: This script only works in WSGI Compitable Servers (Most Linux Distros will work fine...!! Windows is not supported...!!)
    1. Unzip the downloaded release ZIP file (using any zip extractor software. eg: WinRAR, 7zip etc.)
    2. Open the extracted folder and Create a new ' .env ' file on that location and configure it as explained earlier (in Configuration / Environment Vriables section) (Use any text editor software or terminal text editors. eg: notepad, vim, nano)
    3. Upload all the extracted files along with the .env file in your server root
    4. Make sure you have already installed **python3** and **pip** in your server (Most linux distros comes with python3 pre-installed. You just need to install pip) To install pip with apt package manager in Ubuntu run this below command in your server terminal:
    ```code
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    ```
    5. Now, to install all the dependencies run this command:
    ```code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    6. Now, to start the bot run this command:
    ```code
    python3 adlinkfly_bot.py
    ```
    7. **To, STOP the bot you can use CTRL + C or this command:**
    ```code
    pkill -SIGINT -f 'gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8080 -w 4 webserver:adlinkflytgbot'
    ```
